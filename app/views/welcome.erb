    <h2>Welcome to the Book Keeper</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome to the Book Keeper! If your anything like me, you wander through the library and book stores and come across all sorts of books you want to read. Lots of times I will take
        pictures of the books I want to read however I always seem to forget and then I never get the opportunity to read that particular book. So I decided to create an app that will
        list the books I want to read. With this app I can add books I want to read and delete them as I have read them. A little organization to my world of chaos.
      <!-- To get started, delete this file (<code>app/views/welcome.erb)</code> and begin adding
      your own actions to <code>application_controller.rb</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal">README</a>.-->
